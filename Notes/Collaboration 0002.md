Thomas First Notes
----
- I just defined an interface for creating and authenticating users. 
- I also added an intergration test project. I'm thinking that we will use this project just as an alternative UI layer. 
- And, I may just junk all of this code and start over with a traditional .net45 app if we can't figure out how to get core to run on your machine. Core isn't important (although it is cool).
